Welcome to My Secure RestAPI Project

This repository houses a C# web application that leverages a RestAPI for user authentication and registration, integrating JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for security and Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) for efficient data management. This project is designed to serve as a robust example for developers looking to enhance their skills in building secure and efficient web applications using modern best practices in C#.

What You Can Learn
1. Secure Authentication with JWT
JWT Implementation: Understand the steps to implement JWT in a C# application, ensuring secure communication between the client and the server.
Security Practices: Learn about the security considerations for storing and handling JWTs to maintain the confidentiality and integrity of user sessions.

2. Password Hashing
Hashing Algorithms: Dive into how passwords are securely hashed before being stored in the database, adding an extra layer of security against data breaches.
Best Practices: Explore the best practices for choosing and implementing hashing algorithms in .NET applications.

3. Data Transfer Objects (DTOs)
Using DTOs: Learn how DTOs are used to efficiently transfer data between the client and server, improving performance and data management.
Design Patterns: Understand the design patterns behind DTOs and how they contribute to cleaner, more maintainable code.

4. API Design and Development
RESTful Principles: Gain insights into RESTful design principles and how they are applied in creating scalable and maintainable APIs.
Version Control: See examples of how to manage API versioning, allowing for backward compatibility and future improvements.

5. Error Handling and Logging
Robust Error Handling: Learn how to implement comprehensive error handling within the API to gracefully manage and respond to exceptions.
Logging Practices: Understand the importance of logging in web applications for debugging and monitoring purposes, and see practical implementations.

6. Unit and Integration Testing
Writing Testable Code: Discover how to write testable code for your API, ensuring reliability and facilitating continuous integration and deployment.
Testing Frameworks: Get acquainted with testing frameworks suitable for C# and how they are applied to test RestAPIs effectively.
